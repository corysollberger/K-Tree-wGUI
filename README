c_k = works, creates the tree
s_k_d = works, and orders the children
e_k = works
r_k = works, but for some reason doesn't find any key past the last child of the root
xs = works
xa = works
xb = works

The GUI works with a few bugs.
- The ComboBox doesn't "drop down" sometimes, but you can select it and use the arrow keys
to change the command
- The Font and color changes, but I couldn't find a way to only make the specific line change, as it affects
the entire JTextArea.

The project seems to work fine for the above methods, with their little bugs.

Start the GUI program by running the main associated with "guiDriver"

Run the c_k command to create the tree, then you may modify the tree with the other commands

Argument 1: the first argument associated with the method
Argument 2: the second argument associated with the method
